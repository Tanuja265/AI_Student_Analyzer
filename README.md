# 📘 Student Performance Analyzer

A Python-based project to analyze student marks data using popular data libraries — ideal for those learning **data handling**, **visualization**, and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project loads a student marks dataset (CSV), processes the data, analyzes performance, and visualizes trends using:
- 📊 **Matplotlib**
- 🌈 **Seaborn**
- 🧮 **Pandas**
- 🔢 **NumPy**

It demonstrates how to clean data, detect top scorers, explore subject-wise distributions, and spot outliers — essential skills for aspiring AI/ML developers.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Load and clean student data
- Calculate total scores and grades
- Visualize:
  - Grade distribution
  - Subject-wise averages
  - Heatmaps for correlations
  - Boxplots to spot outliers
  - Pairwise relationships
